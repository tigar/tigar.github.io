I program pieces of algorithmic art, bake lots of bread, work at summer camps, and (recently) attempt to knit hats. 

I graduated Carleton College in 2018 with a degree in Computer Science and incredible friends. 

I spent the fall after college at the [Recurse Center][rc-site], an educational retreat for programmers in Brooklyn, NY that I cannot recommend enough for anyone and everyone. 

In August of 2019 I was robbed and was left on the street with a gnarly skull fracture. I'm still recovering and working part time as a computer science tutor and teacher in Berkeley to fill the odd hours. As of right now, I'm looking for full time work! You can see my resume [here]({{ site.url }}/docs/TigarAdamResume.pdf).
