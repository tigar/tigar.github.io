I program pieces of algorithmic art, draw, bake lots of bread, rock climb, and (most recently) attempt to knit hats. 

I graduated Carleton College in 2018 with a degree in Computer Science and incredible friends. 

I spent the fall after college at the [Recurse Center][rc-site], an educational retreat for programmers in Brooklyn, NY that I cannot recommend enough for anyone and everyone. 

I currently work at Blackline and am based in Oakland, CA.
