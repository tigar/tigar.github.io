One of my favorite projects to fiddle with and teach others how to make is [Lookback][lookback-live]. Simple, fun swirling circles that I'd encourage you to spend some time using before diving into a how-to. This tutorial assums a base line knowledge of if statements, for loops, classes, and lists, but you could easily work through the code without that knowledge.

### 1. How to Knit
My friend Lang took some time over the holidays to teach me. All Iâ€™ve produced so far is some pot holders (imagination squares as I like to call them) and the beginnings of a hat.

### 2. The basics of Jeykll
In December I started the process of updating my personal website. The most recent iteration stayed for far too long and was a bit of a hassle to update.

### 3. Atan2
Super critical for day9 of Advent of Code (a 25 day coding challenge) with some interesting math! Transforming cartesian to polar coordinates has never been so easy.

### 4. The basics of Swift
One of the students I tutor had an interest in learning the basics of iOS development so I dove in and learned a bunch myself. I opened Xcode for maybe the third time ever on my laptop and have been super pleased with the UI!

### 5. How to make better vegetarian curry
